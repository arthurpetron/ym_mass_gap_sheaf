# Sorry Ledger

This ledger lists every `sorry` in the Lean formalization, per
`AGENTS.md` Rule 6.

Every `sorry` in `lean/` must appear here with:

- **milestone** — which `work_plan.md` milestone the obligation belongs to,
- **file** — `lean/YMGap/.../foo.lean`,
- **theorem / def name**,
- **obligation** — what the `sorry` stands for, in one sentence,
- **constructive or propositional** — whether discharging the obligation requires producing a witness (constructive) or only a propositional truth.

A `sorry` standing for a **constructive** obligation must never be closed later by a classical proof without explicit sign-off recorded in this ledger.

## Entries

_No `sorry`s logged. The first entries will appear when a milestone surfaces a load-bearing obligation that cannot be discharged with the constructive tooling available at the time._
