This project is a Mathlib-free Lean 4 formalization of a constructive route
from four-dimensional lattice gauge theory to continuum quantum Yang--Mills.
The active physical model is SU(2) BF4 lattice data. Existence statements are
required to carry witnesses and explicit moduli; numerical exploration is not
part of the trusted proof.

## Whole-project goal

The Clay target requires a non-trivial quantum Yang--Mills theory on
`R^4`, satisfying suitable QFT axioms, with an isolated vacuum and a uniform
mass gap `Delta > 0` for every compact simple gauge group. The repository is
currently pursuing SU(2) as the concrete non-abelian construction; a valid
all-group lift remains separate work.

`PROVED` means kernel-checked at exactly the displayed scope. It does not mean
that downstream arrows have been proved. `PARTIAL` means concrete objects and
useful theorems exist but a required bridge is missing.

## Current frontier

The present bottleneck is a cutoff-uniform gap for the **actual physical SU(2)
BF4 vacuum-sector transfer**, not an abstract spectral theorem.

The most recent proved step is the Casimir/heat payment for an inward mate at
the physical nome `w = 1/2`. For a parity-uniform six-face cube, Lean proves:

- a non-vacuum even source heat product is at most `64` times its inward
  mate's heat product;
- an odd source heat product is at most `1/4096` times its inward mate's heat
  product.

These are
`sixHeatProduct_evenInwardMate_le_sixtyFour` and
`sixHeatProduct_oddInwardMate_le_oneOver4096` in
[`BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateHeatBound.lean`](lean/YMGap/Continuum/BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateHeatBound.lean).

The local SU(2) fusion debt is now also exact and kernel-checked. Lowering two
positive incident labels preserves their Clebsch--Gordan ladder except for
its stretched top channel. At the production link-multiplicity level, every
source path is bounded by the inward-mate path count plus one explicit
stretched-channel continuation. See
[`BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateFusionSupport.lean`](lean/YMGap/Continuum/BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateFusionSupport.lean).

The local comparison now also transports across arbitrary physical incident
spin orderings, provided the two geometric permutation witnesses are supplied.
This is
`explicitValenceMultiplicity_physical_inwardMate_of_permutations` in
[`BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateFusionReordering.lean`](lean/YMGap/Continuum/BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateFusionReordering.lean).
The generic finite-box incidence step is now closed as well:
`incidentPhysicalSpins_twoFace_permutations` constructively moves any two
distinct incident plaquette IDs to the front of the source and mate words with
one shared residual word, and
`incidentPhysicalSpins_twoFace_inwardMate_le_add_stretched` immediately feeds
those witnesses into the production multiplicity inequality. See
[`BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateIncidentOrder.lean`](lean/YMGap/Continuum/BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateIncidentOrder.lean).

The cube-specific geometry is now closed too.  The twelve-entry production
table is compiled into exact corrected-slab numerical incidence: at every
cube-boundary link the two recorded selected face IDs occur, are distinct, and
exhaust the selected six-face support.  Thus the global six-face mate restricts
to the proved local two-face mate, yielding the actual corrected-slab
multiplicity bound with one explicit stretched continuation.  See
[`BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateCubeIncidence.lean`](lean/YMGap/Continuum/BF4PhysicalVacuumSectorInwardMateCubeIncidence.lean).

The next causal step is now genuinely global: reroute precisely those twelve
stretched-channel continuations through complete strand components and compare
the complete fixed-boundary intertwiner contraction. A genuine physical
mate-transition floor would then feed a rooted-subtree Hardy--Poincare or
posterior conditional-variance estimate.

An earlier plan tried to bound the whole new-cutoff self-return trace by a
small constant. Exact exploratory computation found that plan false already
at cutoff four: a single state has self-return about `0.71428`, and six
symmetric copies make the positive trace exceed four. This computation is a
route-selection diagnostic only; no floating-point value enters a theorem.

For the detailed live dependency map, see [`work_plan.md`](work_plan.md).
For the source-based group audit, see
[`audits/AUDIT-GROUP-DEPENDENCE.md`](audits/AUDIT-GROUP-DEPENDENCE.md). That
audit found that the strand machinery is hard-coded to the SU(2)
Clebsch--Gordan rule and that no source dependency bridge currently connects
the component chain to the generic `singleStep` obligation. Accordingly, this
README makes no claim that group dependence is closed.

## Trust and constructivity rules

The Lean development is intentionally stricter than ordinary Lean code:

- no Mathlib dependencies;
- no `Classical.choice`, excluded-middle shortcut, or `native_decide` in
  load-bearing proofs;
- constructive reals carry explicit Cauchy moduli;
- witness-bearing existence claims use data-bearing structures or sigma
  types;
- load-bearing declarations are inspected with `#print axioms`; the permitted
  project gate is `propext` and `Quot.sound` only;
- unproved obligations and conditional interfaces are recorded in
  [`lean/SORRY_LEDGER.md`](lean/SORRY_LEDGER.md), rather than being described
  as completed physics.

Python and Rust may perform expensive searches or generate compact exact
certificates. They are **untrusted producers**: Lean must parse the resulting
finite data and independently check every semantic condition and inequality.

## Building safely

Lean is pinned by [`lean/lean-toolchain`](lean/lean-toolchain). Builds must use
the monitored launcher; bare `lake build` and bare `lake env lean` bypass the
repository's crash safeguards.

```bash
# Full monitored Lean build
make lean-build

# Narrow target (preferred while developing)
python3 scripts/safe_lean_build.py --jobs 1 -- +YMGap.Continuum.ModuleName:olean

# Check one source and emit only its importable olean (parent directory exists)
python3 scripts/safe_lean_build.py --check lean/YMGap/Continuum/ModuleName.lean \
  --check-output lean/.lake/build/lib/lean/YMGap/Continuum/ModuleName.olean

# Monitored axiom audit
make lean-audit
```

See [`docs/lean-build-safety.md`](docs/lean-build-safety.md) for memory and
worker limits.

The auxiliary Python tools require Python 3.11 or newer:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
make test
make lint
```

Other common targets are `make figures` and `make paper` (the latter requires
a working LaTeX installation with `latexmk`).

## How to evaluate a claim in this repository

Check all four of the following:

1. the exact theorem statement and its parameter range;
2. its printed axiom dependencies;
3. whether its hypotheses have concrete inhabitants, rather than only a
   conditional compiler;
4. whether the next bridge in [`lean/SORRY_LEDGER.md`](lean/SORRY_LEDGER.md)
   is still open.

A finite-cutoff theorem, a fixed-coupling clustering estimate, or a compiler
of the form “if certificate `C`, then gap” is valuable progress, but none is
by itself a continuum Yang--Mills mass-gap theorem.
