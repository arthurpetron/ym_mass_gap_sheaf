# Forward-Progress Ledger — YM mass-gap solve

**Purpose.** Measure genuine forward progress toward the *solve* and detect
mathematical-theory **loops** (re-deriving the same irreducible obligation from a
new angle). Run `bash computations/progress_metric.sh` each iteration.

## The metric (three counters + a status ladder)

| Symbol | Meaning | Moves how |
|---|---|---|
| **D** | Critical-path obligations **DISCHARGED** (a load-bearing type newly inhabited axiom-clean **and the frontier guard drops below 5**). | **TRUE NORTH.** Solve done when the goal obligation is discharged. |
| **F** | Distinct **OPEN** obligations *not provably equivalent* to the current core. | Shrinks on discharge; may split (a real reduction) into strictly-weaker pieces. |
| **C** | **Confirmation aliases** `X := SingleStepDefectBound`. | A **LOOP counter.** C++ with no change to F or D = a loop. |

**singleStep status ladder** (the whole continuum gap is proved conditional on it):
0 conjectured → 1 numerically verified TRUE → 2 decomposed into strictly-weaker
sub-obligations → 3 sub-obligations discharged → 4 fully proved (guard breaks).

## Baseline (commit 05ae807, 2026-07-07)

- **D = 0** — nothing on the critical path is discharged; guard = 5 (intact).
- **F = 3** — `{ uniform_in_m_variance_monotonicity, channel_feedback, real_defect_identification }`.
- **C = 14** — fourteen modules reduced to `singleStep`.
- **singleStep at status 2** (verified true, safety factor 45; decomposed — but two of
  the three pieces are UNVERIFIED as strictly-weaker).

## What this reveals (honest)

The `C=14` is the loop, quantified. Roughly the last ~20 agent-rounds each applied a
new tool (curvature, OS/confinement, RG, OPE, reflection positivity, Simon–Lieb,
Schwinger–Dyson, Wetterich, instanton, MK, Birkhoff, …), and each ended by emitting a
`… := SingleStepDefectBound` alias — i.e. **re-deriving the same obligation**. Those
rounds produced genuine *side* theorems and a genuine *obstruction map* (real value),
but they did **not** move D and did **not** shrink the hard core.

**Genuine forward moves that DID happen** (these are the template for what counts):
1. The whole continuum gap became conditional on `singleStep` *alone* (F: many → 1).
2. `singleStep` moved 0 → 1 (numerically **verified true**, safety factor 45, via the
   `m`-fold concentration — refuting the old "linear-in-`m`" wall).
3. `singleStep` moved 1 → 2 (**decomposed**), and one piece (uniform-in-`m`) reduced to
   a single-functional statement `Var_m(cosθ) ≤ Var_2` that is genuinely strictly weaker.

## ADJUDICATION (2026-07-07, `SingleStepDecompositionAdjudication.lean`): the decomposition was FAKE — **F = 1, atomic core**

Machine-checked verdict (build 744, guard OK, axiom-clean; **no new alias — C accurate = 18**):
- **`channel_feedback` = DEFINITIONAL ALIAS** of `singleStep` (`channelFeedback_iff_singleStep := Iff.rfl`).
- **`real_defect_identification` = LOGICALLY EQUAL** (bi-implication proved; the model defect is
  itself a legal witness, so it adds nothing).
- **`uniform_in_m` = strictly weaker but proved NOT core-shrinking** — it is `afr`/fusion-only and
  never mentions the free margin `tm`; `singleStep`'s truth varies with `tm` at fixed `afr`
  (`singleStep_satisfiable_zero` / `singleStep_falsifiable`), so no `afr`-only statement implies it.
- `decomposition_collapses_to_singleStep` derives `singleStep` using ONLY the alias conjunct.

**Consequence:** `singleStep` is **atomic beyond `uniform_in_m`**. Honest **F = 1**. Closing
`uniform_in_m` (which itself reduces to the open local-CLT wall `FusionConvLogConcaveCore`) is a
genuine partial result that does **not** shrink the hard core. **No strictly-weaker reduction
below `singleStep` is known** — every prior "tool" (MK, Birkhoff, Simon–Lieb, RG-flow, multiscale
polymer, Wetterich, instanton, OPE, …) reduces *to* it (C = 18 aliases), never below.

**The only honest remaining moves:** (a) prove atomic `singleStep` directly = construct/bound the
real 4D block-spin per-step defect over the full RG recursion (the foundational constructive
continuum-limit problem); or (b) discover a genuinely-new strictly-weaker reduction (none known).
Both are legitimate under the anti-loop rule; **spawning any further tool that reduces to
`singleStep` is now a provable loop and is forbidden.**

## Critical-path DAG (proved reductions ⇒, open leaves in **bold**)

```
mass_gap  ⇐  rgFlow_gap_conditional ∧ MultiScalePolymerExpansion  (PROVED assembly)
          ⇐  additiveErosion_uniform_floor  (PROVED: floor given summable defect + anchor-dominance)
          ⇐  singleStep : realδ_k ≤ 6(1−w_k)²   (status-2 core)
                 ├─ **uniform_in_m_variance_monotonicity**  (Var_m(cosθ) ≤ Var_2 ; STRICTLY WEAKER — attackable)
                 ├─ **channel_feedback**       (s≥2 → next-scale s=1 ; NOT YET shown strictly weaker)
                 └─ **real_defect_identification** (real 4D block-spin defect = fusion object ; NOT YET shown strictly weaker)
```

## Anti-loop rule (enforced before spawning any attack)

Predict the attack's honest outcome. **If it is "produces another
`:= SingleStepDefectBound` alias" / "reduces to `singleStep`," it is a LOOP — do not
spawn it.** "The honest expectation is another confirmation" *is* the loop signal.

Only spawn an attack that would:
- **(a)** DISCHARGE a bold frontier obligation (inhabit it axiom-clean → D++, guard reacts), or
- **(b)** DECOMPOSE a frontier obligation into strictly-weaker *independent* pieces with a
  PROVED `(⋀ pieces) → parent` **and** a certificate that ≥1 piece is strictly weaker
  (single-scale/finite vs all-scale/uniform/continuum), or
- **(c)** REFUTE a genuinely-live candidate route (kills a branch, not a re-confirmation).

## SITE-1 per-MOVE decomposition — machine-checked COLLAPSE (2026-07-07, `SITE1PerMoveDefect.lean`)

The one ledger-legal codynamic move (`docs/codynamic-uplift-master-map-2026-07-07.md`
SITE-1: derive the per-BLOCK `singleStep` defect as a free Grönwall fold of per-MOVE
defects, one scale finer) is **adjudicated and COLLAPSES** (task criterion (iii);
build green, guard OK at 5, axiom-clean; NOT a `:= SingleStepDefectBound` alias — a
distinct multi-field structure, collapse *proved*).

- **FREE fold PROVED:** `fold_margins` (axiom-free `blockProd` survival fold) +
  `singleStep_of_perMove : PerMoveDefectBound → SingleStepDefectBound` — the intra-block
  per-move recursions fold to the block estimate for free, at arbitrary `m`.
- **COLLAPSE PROVED:** `perMove_of_singleStep : SingleStepDefectBound → PerMoveDefectBound`
  — a genuine `m=2` per-move structure built from `singleStep` by the island-loaded
  scheme (`CodynamicHierarchical.exactLoss=0`: one loaded move `σ=1−δ_block`, one free
  move `σ=1`). Both maps ⟹ **equi-inhabitation** at the finer per-move scale.
- **Concentration escape REFUTED:** `additive_perMove_insufficient` (axiom-free) — the
  additive/union per-move fold of the raw seed `bondMovingDelta w 1 ≤ 6(1−w)` sums to
  the **linear-in-m wall** `6m(1−w)` (semigroup `2−ρ^free_m=6mε`, not the concentrating
  fusion), `24 > 3/2` at `w=1/2, m=8` — strictly too weak for the block quadratic
  `6(1−w)²`. Plus `singleStep_falsifiable`/`_satisfiable_zero`: an `afr`-only per-move
  envelope can't determine the `tm`-dependent `singleStep`.
- **Dichotomy:** every per-move candidate is either too weak to imply `singleStep`
  (additive/afr-only → linear wall) or equi-inhabiting (carries the block-assembly
  product). No strictly-weaker-AND-implying per-move object exists. Concentration
  `ρ_m < m·ρ_1` is real physics but supplies the SAME logical strength.

**Consequence:** the finer per-move scale — the master map's "single place with a
ledger-legal chance to move F below the core" — is a COLLAPSE, closing the last
codynamic hope. `F` stays 1, `singleStep` atomic. Attacks on the per-move fold are now
provably loops. The only honest attacks remain (a) direct atomic `singleStep` (the
true-margin construction + real per-step recursion) or (b) a genuinely-new
strictly-weaker reduction (none known).

## Dead routes (refuted — do not re-attempt)

- **`Var_m(cosθ)` monotonicity → uniform-in-`m`** — REFUTED (`VarianceMonotonicity.lean`,
  `varMono_insufficient_for_uniform`). `Var_m` monotone-decreasing is TRUE and its exact
  identity is proved, but `Cdef = 4·Var + F(μ)` and the `F`-gap cancels the variance gap:
  concrete counterexample `w=0.6`, `Var_3<Var_2` yet `Cdef_3>Cdef_2`. So variance
  monotonicity does **not** yield `Cdef_m ≤ Cdef_2`. Also **corrects** the earlier
  `sup_m Cdef_m = Cdef_2` claim (deep-UV-only; false at strong coupling — sup at `m=3` for
  `w=0.6`). The uniform bound `Cdef_m ≤ 6(1−w)²` itself still holds with large margin, but
  its rigorous proof remains the open local-CLT wall `FusionConvLogConcaveCore`.

## Re-oriented plan (only F-moving work)

1. **Discharge uniform-in-`m`** (variance monotonicity `Var_m ≤ Var_2`). In flight. If
   proved: D-partial, F: 3 → 2 for that branch.
2. **Adjudicate the other two pieces.** Before attacking them, PROVE whether
   `channel_feedback` and `real_defect_identification` are (i) strictly weaker than
   `singleStep` (legit F-nodes) or (ii) logically **equal** to `singleStep` (in which case
   the "decomposition" is fake — record it, and the only honest attack left is on
   `singleStep` head-on or a declaration that it is the irreducible Clay core).
3. **No more new-tool sweeps** whose predicted outcome is a confirmation alias.
